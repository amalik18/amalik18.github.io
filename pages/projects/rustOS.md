# **Writing an Operating System in Rust**
I've always wanted to play around with writing an operating system but, I never knew where to start. A few months ago I discovered Philipp Oppermann's [blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/) and on there he has a tutorial for writing a very minimalistic operating system in Rust. Since then, I've been following the tutorials as well as making changes where I see fit.
